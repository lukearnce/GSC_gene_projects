External data that I haven't edited, like original datasets I collected, got from collaborators, or downloaded. 

Ensembl compara predicted GSC gene orthology (10 Drosophila and 2 outgroup species)

CDS downloaded for 41 species total

RBH BLAST from INPARANOID used to refine ortholog predictions along with PRANK and maxAlign.

Primers for validation of predicted absences
